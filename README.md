Mumble-SoundByteBot
===================

A simple bot that plays sound bytes in response to text commands. Right now 
it needs MPD setup, and is very hacky. This is my first adventure into the 
land of Ruby.

TODO
----

- Cut MPD as a dependency
- Add in more flexibility in configuration options
- Make sure it's actually set up like a proper ruby project
- Add setup instructions here
